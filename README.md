# GreenEarth

In the United States alone, we generate about 300 million tons of solid waste in just a year. Half of that amount goes straight to the landfill, where it is stored. The landfill is more or less a static environment - when a landfill is overcapacity, itâ€™s sealed off with liner to prevent leakage. The trash continues to decompose underneath, generating many byproducts such as leachate which is contaminated rainwater, and carbon monoxide from bacteria which contributes to rising CO2 levels in our air. Even worse, 15% of landfill trash is actually compostable, reusable and recyclable. How do we, as long-term residents of earth, reduce this waste?

GreenEarth is an interactive and collaborative website where people can find creative projects, posted by other members of the community, that utilize common household trash and repurpose them into useful household items or cool art projects.
